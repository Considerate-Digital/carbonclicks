### GDPR Compliance

CarbonClicks prides itself on its approach to GDPR compliance. The service does not retain any identifying data about users, including IP addresses.

Both services are chosen for their commitment to not storing identifying data, aligning with Considerate Digital's privacy principles.

### Standards and measurement

The accuracy and reliability of CarbonClicks is important to us. We use CO2.js, a peer-reviewed and open-source software library provided by the Green Web Foundation, to perform our calculations. This tool allows us to accurately measure the average carbon emission of each webpage per visitor, assess whether your hosting solution is environmentally friendly and to verify the sustainability claims made by your hosting service. We give every webpage a rating based on the Digital Carbon Rating Scale, a metric developed through collaboration by Sustainable Web Design (SWD). This clear rating system provides an instantly understandable assessment of your website's environmental impact.
