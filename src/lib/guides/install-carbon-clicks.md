## CarbonClicks is designed to provide high-quality insights and essential metrics crucial for understanding the carbon footprint of digital products and services. Follow our guide to install CarbonClicks on your website.

### How to install CarbonClicks

The CarbonClicks is free to use for small and medium sized organisations with moderate web traffic. Once installed, it works on any website and records your website's carbon emissions in real time.
We developed CarbonClicks with the aim of providing high quality carbon emissions metrics for all websites. You can read more about CarbonClicks in our [overview](/guide/analytics) of the software.

### Code

Adding CarbonClicks directly into your website's HTML requires a basic understanding of coding and web development. For those who prefer a more straightforward approach, continue reading below for alternative installation methods.

1. Login to [CarbonClicks](/dashboard/login).
2. Add the code to your website's HTML files. If you are using any sort of templating or a framework, then you want to add this script in a place where it will load on every page. We would suggest placing the script at the top of the "body" tag but anywhere inside the "body" tag will work.
3. That's it. Once your site has been visited by a user, you can refresh CarbonClicks dashboard and see your carbon emissions appear.
4. Please let us know how you get on. We are keen to improve CarbonClicks for everyone, so if you spot any improvements that could be made please fill out our [feedback form](https://forms.gle/rTZexidLN7Eq6UY16).
