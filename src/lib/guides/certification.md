## Website certification with Considerate Digital: a commitment to net zero and climate crisis resolution.

Certifying your website is a significant step towards acknowledging and addressing the climate crisis. When you certify a webpage with Considerate Digital, you demonstrate your commitment to achieving net zero emissions and engaging proactively with environmental sustainability. Considerate Digital's certification service aligns with established industry standards, making it easier for businesses and individuals alike to contribute positively to the global effort against climate change.

### Why certifiy?

Digital carbon emissions are an essential component of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) reporting, particularly for scope 3, category 11 emissions, which pertain to indirect emissions that are a consequence of the activities of an organisation but occur from sources not owned or controlled by it -- in short, this includes websites, apps and other digital products. Additionally, it plays a crucial role in Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) metrics for businesses, offering a tangible way to demonstrate a commitment to sustainable practices.

Understanding and reducing digital emissions begins with awareness. You can only start to lower your digital emissions once you're fully aware of them and have access to high-quality metrics. This is where the benefits of certification become evident. Not only does it provide a clear overview of your website's carbon footprint, but it also makes this information accessible to the public. Anyone can check the certification status of any website using the search function on Considerate Digital's homepage or through our open API, which we'll discuss in more detail later.

### How to become certified

Obtaining certification for your website is a straightforward process:

1. Visit the [Considerate Digital's carbon homepage](/).
2. Enter your webpage's address (URL) to reveal the digital emissions and rating.
3. Provide your email address and await a confirmation link.
4. Click on the link sent to your email to finalise the process.
5. Download your certificate and badge and display them on your webpage to showcase your commitment to sustainability.

### Standards and measurement

The accuracy and reliability of our certification process are paramount. We use CO2.js, a peer-reviewed and open-source software library provided by the Green Web Foundation, to perform our calculations. This tool allows us to accurately measure the average carbon emission of each webpage per visitor, assess whether your hosting solution is environmentally friendly and to verify the sustainability claims made by your hosting service. We give every webpage a rating based on the Digital Carbon Rating Scale, a metric developed through collaboration by Sustainable Web Design (SWD). This clear rating system provides an instantly understandable assessment of your website's environmental impact.
